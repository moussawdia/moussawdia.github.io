My name is Moussa Dia and I've created this website to document my adventures in GIS. I'm a native to Arligton, VA and graduated from [William & Mary](https://www.wm.edu/){:target="_blank"} in May of 2018. As an undergraduate I studied Geology.  After graduating, I remained in Williamsburg, VA for another year as a Center for Geospatial Analysis (CGA) Fellow where I was able to hone my skills in GIS.
